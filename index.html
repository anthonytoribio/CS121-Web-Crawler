            <h1><strong>Minesweeper Artificial Intelligence (2021)</strong></h1>
            <p>This was the first project related to artificial intelligence that I had taken on.
               Luckily, I also had a very capable partner working with me on this one. Given multiple minesweeper boards
               of difficulties ranging from easy to expert, our goal was to develop an AI that would be able to solve as 
               many of these boards as possible. We utilized various well known and helpful AI heuristics to make our bot
               as accurate as possible. By the time we finished, our AI was capable of beating easy and medium boards with a 
               77% accuracy and the expert boards with 19% accuracy. Our bot's accuracies weren't the best, but for our first time
               developing an AI, this was pretty decent. All in all, it was a very fun and educational project.

            <h1><strong>Columns (2019)</strong></h1>
            <p>This was the first big CS class project that I had been assigned. It was only my second CS college course
               and I was excited to show off what I had learned in the little time I had been here so far. The project was split
               into two assignments. The first assignment had us create the game "Columns" and all of its game mechanics and have it be
               playable entirely only from the python shell. Next, I had to implement a visually pleasing game interface for it
               using the pygame python module. I added cool sound effects, dramatic background music, and added graphics to make the 
               game look nicer. From this project, I got a lot of experience working with external python modules I wasn't too familiar with.

            <h1><strong>Snake (2021)</strong></h1>
            <p>This was a python project that I did on my own time using the pygame module. I wanted to challenge myself 
               and make a game without getting any external help to see how well I could do. It was also to refresh my pygame 
               knowledge from the "Columns" project that I had done two years prior. I also wanted to prove to myself that I had 
               improved my coding abilities drastically and this was evident in how much smoother this game ran than my old "Columns"
               project. I'm pretty happy with how this came out and it didn't even take that much time to create.
